SCHEDULER2.SH is our main file. Everything is linked to this file respectively.

to run the files 12 times:
./scheduler2.sh 

MAKE SURE THE FILE IS IN EXECUTABLE MODE.

To get the processing output: 

ps -ef | grep scheduler.sh

It will give smth like this;
rida        1462    1434  0 02:40 pts/0    00:00:00 /bin/bash /home/rida/CEP/scheduler.sh
rida        1558    1434  0 02:43 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto scheduler.sh

1462 is the PID.

TO STOP THE FILE RUNNING 12 TIMES, WE'LL WRITE IN TERMINAL;

Kill 1462 
OR
Kill -9 1462 

cat fetch_and_parse.log (This file will be visible after 12 itr)
To see the iterations running. 

THE LOG FILE ALSO HAVE THE CONDITION TO CHECK IF THE AVG IS PRINTED IN THE weather_analysis_output.txt FILE. 
To check any error, we can either go to fetch_and_parse_error.log or fetch_and_parse.log. 


Upon running scheduler2 everytime, the temp.csv files get empty and will only save the data from the last 12 rows of weather_parsed.csv.

THE FINAL AVERAGE WEATHER ANALYSIS WILL BE PRINTED IN THE SCREEN AS WELL and Alert email will also be sent to the recipient user (ridanafeesqasmi@gmail.com).
